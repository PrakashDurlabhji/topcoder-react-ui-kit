# Topcoder React UI Kit Changelog

### v0.2.0
- **[Breaking change]:** The following color constants have been dropped:
  `$tc-dark-blue-90`, `$tc-gold-70`, `$tc-gold-30`, `$tc-gold-10`; use instead:
  `$tc-dark-blue`, `$tc-yellow-70`, `$tc-yellow-30`, `tc-yellow-10`.

- Values of `$tc-gold`, `$tc-silver`, `$tc-bronze` color constants are updated
  (metal colors for placements, etc.). Additional colors introduced:
  `$tc-gold-110`, `$tc-gold-130`, `$tc-silver-110`, `$tc-silver-130`,
  `$tc-bronze-110`, `$tc-bronze-130`; these are intended for text color
  inside areas filled by metal colors: use `110` color variants for middle
  font size and larger, use `130` for small text size.

### v0.1.0
The first release.

### v0.0.x
Pre-release drafts of the initial package version. A big journey starts here.
